                    We started Little Beast because we wanted something a little
                    nicer for our dog. We weren’t inspired by what was in the
                    market. Frankly, we felt most pet products were 
                    uninspiring, low quality and kitschy. We just want to make 
                    good stuff with good taste. We also want to work with people
                    who share the same values. That’s why we work with 
                    family-owned businesses, husband and wife teams like us, 
                    who build things by hand and in small batches. We also 
                    understand the impact fashion has on the environment. So, 
                    we’re constantly looking for ways to reduce our impact on 
                    our planet.

                <h2>Little Beast Throughout the Years</h2>
                <div id="title-1">
                    <h3>2018</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We took matters into our own hands and threw our life 
                    savings on handmade collars and leashes. They were really 
                    hard to make. We didn’t sell a whole alot. Oh, and our life 
                    savings was gone.
                </p>
                <div id="title-2">
                    <h3>2019</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    With hundreds of unsold collars and leashes, we pivoted 
                    to a new idea: operating on online boutique from our 800 
                    square-foot NYC apartment. LOL It was crazy aaand it 
                    didn't work out, again.
                </p>
                <div id="title-3">
                    <h3>2020</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We made the shift to focus on pet clothing. With Jisu 
                    and Lys’ background in art, we felt we could bring a 
                    unique take to it. We designed and launched our first 
                    collection for the FW 2020 season. To our absolute 
                    surprise, we actually started to sell stuff!
                </p>
                <div id="title-4">
                    <h3>2021 to Today</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We now work on Little Beast full time. We're still a 
                    team of three people just trying to make things happen! 
                    We are focused on creating new products that we hope 
                    will make everyone who comes across it, smile and feel 
                    good. Woohoo!
                </p>

                    Little Beast exists to bring good vibes and positive 
                    energy to the world. We want to use our products to 
                    promote a net positive impact on the world. We also want
                    to remind everyone to be kind and lead with empathy. 
                    Kindness is free. It can make the world a better place.
