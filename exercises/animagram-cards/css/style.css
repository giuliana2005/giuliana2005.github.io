  Three Primary Ways to Center Elements Based On Their Step.

  Text-align: center; will any text that is inside of the container it is 
  applied to. Now, text align center will also work on the inline objects such 
  as spans and img elements. Text align will also transcend to any decendants no
  matter how deep.

  Width property + Margin property with left and right set to auto. For this to 
  work, this element has these styles MUST be a block, flex, or grid element.
  Will not work on any other element.

  If you are looking to center CHILDREN elements inside of a container element.
  This will be done on the container element itself. You must have either a
  display: flex; or display: grid; property on that container element and then 
  you can use justify-content OR align-items OR both horizontally or vertically
  center the CHILDREN elements within that container.
