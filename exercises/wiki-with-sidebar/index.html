                    Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the 
                    creation of clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, and
                    jewellery of different cultural aesthetics and their mix 
                    and match into outfits that depict distinctive ways of 
                    dressing (styles and trends) as signifiers of social 
                    status, self-expression, and group belonging. As a 
                    multifaceted term, fashion describes an industry, designs, 
                    aesthetics, and trends.

                        The term 'fashion' originates from the Latin word 'Facere,' 
                        which means 'to make,' and describes the manufacturing, 
                        mixing, and wearing of outfits adorned with specific 
                        cultural aesthetics, patterns, motifs, shapes, and cuts, 
                        allowing people to showcase their group belongings, values, 
                        meanings, beliefs, and ways of life. Given the rise in mass 
                        production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and 
                        global reach, reducing fashion's environmental impact and 
                        improving sustainability has become an urgent issue among 
                        politicians, brands, and consumers.[1][2]

                        The French word mode, meaning "fashion", dates as far 
                        back as 1482, while the English word denoting something 
                        "in style" dates only to the 16th century. Other words 
                        exist related to concepts of style and appeal that 
                        precede mode. In the 12th and 13th century Old French 
                        the concept of elegance begins to appear in the context 
                        of aristocratic preferences to enhance beauty and 
                        display refinement, and cointerie, the idea of making 
                        oneself more attractive to others by style or artifice 
                        in grooming and dress, appears in a 13th-century poem by
                        Guillaume de Lorris advising men that "handsome clothes
                        and handsome accessories improve a man a great deal".
                        [3]

                        Fashion scholar Susan B. Kaiser states that everyone is 
                        "forced to appear", unmediated before others.[4] 
                        Everyone is evaluated by their attire, and evaluation 
                        includes the consideration of colors, materials, 
                        silhouette, and how garments appear on the body. 
                        Garments identical in style and material also appear 
                        different depending on the wearer's body shape, or 
                        whether the garment has been washed, folded, mended, 
                        or is new.

                        Fashion is defined in a number of different ways, and 
                        its application can be sometimes unclear. Though the 
                        term fashion connotes difference, as in "the new 
                        fashions of the season", it can also connote sameness, 
                        for example in reference to "the fashions of the 1960s",
                        implying a general uniformity. Fashion can signify the 
                        latest trends, but may often reference fashions of a 
                        previous era, leading to the reappearance of fashions 
                        from a different time period. While what is fashionable
                        can be defined by a relatively insular, esteemed and 
                        often rich aesthetic elite who make a look exclusive, 
                        such as fashion houses and haute couturiers, this 
                        'look' is often designed by pulling references from 
                        subcultures and social groups who are not considered 
                        elite, and are thus excluded from making the 
                        distinction of what is fashion themselves.

                        Whereas a trend often connotes a peculiar aesthetic 
                        expression, often lasting shorter than a season and 
                        being identifiable by visual extremes, fashion is a 
                        distinctive and industry-supported expression 
                        traditionally tied to the fashion season and 
                        collections.[5] Style is an expression that lasts 
                        over many seasons and is often connected to cultural 
                        movements and social markers, symbols, class, and 
                        culture (such as Baroque and Rococo). According to 
                        sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, fashion connotes "the 
                        latest difference."[6]

                        Even though the terms fashion, clothing and costume are 
                        often used together, fashion differs from both. Clothing
                        describes the material and the technical garment, 
                        devoid of any social meaning or connections; costume 
                        has come to mean fancy dress or masquerade wear. 
                        Fashion, by contrast, describes the social and temporal
                        system that influences and "activates" dress as a 
                        social signifier in a certain time and context. 
                        Philosopher Giorgio Agamben connects fashion to the 
                        qualitative Ancient Greek concept of kairos, meaning 
                        "the right, critical, or opportune moment", and 
                        clothing to the quantitative concept of chronos, the 
                        personification of chronological or sequential time.

                        While some exclusive brands may claim the label haute 
                        couture, in France, the term is technically limited to 
                        members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture[8] 
                        in Paris.[5] Haute couture is more aspirational; 
                        inspired by art and culture, and in most cases, reserved
                        for the economic elite. However, New York's fashion 
                        calendar hosts Couture Fashion Week, which strives for 
                        a more equitable and inclusive mission.[9]

                        Fashion is also a source of art, allowing people to 
                        display their unique tastes, sensibilities, and styles.
                        [10] Different fashion designers are influenced by 
                        outside stimuli and reflect this inspiration in their 
                        work. For example, Gucci's 'stained green' jeans[11]
                        may look like a grass stain, but to others, they 
                        display purity, freshness, and summer.[12]

                    <p>
                        Fashion is unique, self-fulfilling and may be a key part
                        of someone's identity. Similarly to art, the aims of a 
                        person's choices in fashion are not necessarily to be 
                        liked by everyone, but instead to be an expression of 
                        personal taste.[10] A person's personal style functions
                        as a "societal formation always combining two opposite
                        principles. It is a socially acceptable and secure 
                        way to distinguish oneself from others and, at the 
                        same time, it satisfies the individual's need for 
                        social adaptation and imitation."[13] While 
                        philosopher Immanuel Kant believed that fashion 
                        "has nothing to do with genuine judgements of taste",
                        and was instead "a case of unreflected and 'blind' 
                        imitation",[13] sociologist Georg Simmel[14] thought
                        of fashion as something that "helped overcome the 
                        distance between an individual and his society".
                        [13] American sociologist Diana Crane also 
                        mentioned in her book that fashion is closely 
                        intertwined with personal and group identity, 
                        serving as a means of expressing cultural, social, 
                        and political affiliations.[15]
